# [Getting started](@id getting-started)

Welcome to JuliaForIDM.jl! This package provides tools for infectious disease modeling in Julia, accompanying the paper "Julia for Applied Infectious Disease Modelling".

If you're new to Julia, we recommend checking out [Modern Julia Workflows](https://modernjuliaworkflows.org/) for an excellent introduction to Julia development practices.

This section will help you get started with JuliaForIDM.jl, whether you want to:
- Use it as a package in your own Julia projects
- Reproduce the complete analysis from the paper
- Interactively explore and modify the models

See the sidebar for installation instructions, quickstart guides, and more detailed documentation.
