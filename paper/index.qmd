## Introduction

The field of infectious disease modeling requires both computational efficiency
and code clarity. Julia [@bezanson2017julia] offers a unique combination of
performance and ease of use that makes it particularly suitable for this domain.

## The Current Landscape of Infectious Disease Modeling

### Computational Challenges in Modern IDM
Discussion of the increasing complexity of models, need for rapid deployment
during outbreaks, and computational bottlenecks in existing approaches.

### Common Tools and Their Limitations
Overview of R, Python, and other current tools, their strengths and limitations
in the IDM context.

## Julia

### Multiple Dispatch and Type System
Discussion of how Julia's type system and multiple dispatch enable clear,
performant model implementations and natural expression of epidemiological
concepts.

### Native Performance
Exploration of how Julia achieves C-like performance while maintaining
high-level syntax, with specific benefits for computationally intensive IDM
tasks.

### Metaprogramming
Overview of Julia's metaprogramming capabilities and their applications in
model specification and domain-specific language creation.

### Package Interoperability
Discussion of Julia's package ecosystem design and how it enables seamless
integration between different modeling components.

## The Scientific Machine Learning Ecosystem

### DifferentialEquations.jl and SciML
Discussion of the comprehensive differential equation solving ecosystem, its
unique features for IDM, and the broader scientific machine learning tools.

## Probabilistic Programming with Turing.jl
Overview of Bayesian inference capabilities, MCMC samplers, and integration
with differential equation models for parameter estimation.

## Automatic Differentiation
Exploration of ForwardDiff.jl, ReverseDiff.jl, and Zygote.jl, with focus on
their applications in optimization and sensitivity analysis for IDM.

## Data Science Tools

### DataFrames.jl
Data manipulation and analysis capabilities particularly relevant to
epidemiological data.

### Visualization
Overview of Plots.jl, Makie.jl, and other visualization tools for both
analysis and communication of results.

## Case Studies

### Case Study 1: SIR Model Implementation
Demonstrating basic model implementation with performance comparisons.

## Discussion

**Summary of Findings**
- Demonstrated Julia's unique position in scientific computing for IDM
- Showed how the ecosystem components work together cohesively
- Illustrated practical benefits through real-world case studies

**Strengths**
- True language-level composability between packages
- No two-language problem: single codebase from prototyping to production
- Rich type system enabling both safety and performance
- Growing, academically-focused ecosystem

**Current Limitations**
- Smaller package ecosystem compared to Python/R
- Learning curve for developers from dynamically-typed backgrounds
- Some IDM-specific tooling still missing
- Package compilation times impact development workflow

**Alternative Approaches in Literature**

*JAX and NumPyro*
While JAX offers automatic differentiation and acceleration, it remains a
framework rather than a language solution. This leads to:
- Limited expressiveness due to Python's underlying type system
- Restricted to purely functional programming patterns
- Complex deployment due to Python packaging challenges
- Less natural problem expression compared to Julia's multiple dispatch

*Stan and Related Tools*
Traditional probabilistic programming languages suffer from:
- Limited flexibility in model specification
- Separation between modeling and analysis environments
- Performance overhead from interface translations

**Future Work**

*Epidemiology-Specific Ecosystem*
Development of a cohesive epidemiology metapackage that:
- Provides domain-specific abstractions for common IDM patterns
- Connects to the broader Julia ecosystem (SciML, Turing.jl, etc.)
- Includes standardized interfaces for:
  * Model specification
  * Parameter estimation
  * Intervention modeling
  * Real-time forecasting

*Technical Improvements*
- Further reducing compilation latency
- Expanding GPU support across the ecosystem
- Developing IDM-specific visualization recipes
- Creating standardized benchmarks for IDM applications

**Conclusions**
Julia represents a significant advance in scientific computing for IDM,
offering a unique combination of performance, expressiveness, and
composability. While some challenges remain, the foundation is set for a
robust, maintainable, and efficient approach to infectious disease modeling.
