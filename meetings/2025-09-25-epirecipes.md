- Add a section on PPLs in Julia
- Add a section on algebraic Julia etc 
- Add a paragraph somewhere about epirecipes, why julia, what,
- Do we need case studies - strong thoughts on what?

Actions:

- Sam to invite you to repository.
- Simon send some names. 
- Sam to set up a meeting.
- Sam to feedback into the outline this conversation and otherwise update.
- Simon and Sandra: Think about examples. What is interesting but not overwhelming. What compliments what you have in Epirecipes without competing duplicating etc.
- Sandra: think about writing up a summary of JuMp (where do the caps go) pulling from your paper
- Simon: Think about a epirecipes paragraph. Why does it exist. What is the aim. What is it. Why is that a good thing.
- Simon and Sandra: Category theory. Why is julia good for it.

General point: Authorship - do not know work out later based on contribution?
General point:  Journal - tricky one maybe plos comp b?
